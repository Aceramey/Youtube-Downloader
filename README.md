This is just a simple script I wrote that uses yt-dlp to download youtube videos

I recommend putting the script in a folder, as the first time it is run it makes a folder named "downloaded". It is not required, but it makes finding downloaded files a little bit easier. 
If you want to do things like convert to audio or download specific formats, ffmpeg is required.
